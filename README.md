# Reading List

I'm not one for books as a means of consuming non-fiction (or non-fiction-adjacent) literature, but I've realized that I'm beginning to accumulate the types of books that may be worth listing.

* [*Black Hearts*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7168870-black-hearts), Jim Frederick, Harmony Books, 2010, ISBN 9780307450753
* [*Good to Great*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76865.Good_to_Great), Jim Collins, Harper Business, 2001, ISBN 9780066620992
* [*The Phoenix Project*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project), Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford, IT Revolution Press, 2014, ISBN 9780988262577

I'll slowly add to this as I read more.
