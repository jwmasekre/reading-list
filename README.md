# Reading List

I'm not one for books as a means of consuming non-fiction (or non-fiction-adjacent) literature, but I've realized that I'm beginning to accumulate the types of books that may be worth listing.

* [*Blackhearts*]()
* [*Good to Great*]()
* [*The Phoenix Project*]()

I'll slowly add to this as I read more.
